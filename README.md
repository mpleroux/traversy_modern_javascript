# README

## Description

These are the local files I created while following the full 38 hour Traversy Media course "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0." The first part is available on YouTube at [React Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI1o2H9z9fo).

- [Project repository](https://github.com/bradtraversy/javascript-sandbox)

I cloned the project repo to start each lesson with scaffolding like HTML files and stylesheets. For there I followed the tutorials and created everything from scratch. My version of the repo contains a handful of directories for self-contained projects like the Shopping List.

### Technologies used

- JavaScript

## To install and run from repo

Everything is run locally using the Live Server VSCode extension.
